#Pathfing Challenge Map Creator
###Introduction
This applications is used to produce an array of clickable point for use in my Pathfining Challenge web application. The application displays a map specified in the code and the user selects point for generating a traveling salesman distance optimization problem. This application was built in one day.
###Use
To create a new set of points:

First specify a map inage by entering it as the background image for the map element in the style.cc file.

Set the number of point groups desired in the main.js file.

Run the application locally in a web browser and set point locations by clicking on the map.

Cycle to the next group by right clicking on the mouse.

When the group limit is reached an array of point locations will be output to the console, the array can then be copied into the Pathfinding Challenge app code to create a new challenge.
###Technologies
Built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
